# Lab5_Figures
This lab is an improvement on lab3. With this assignment, I implemented a header file with function prototypes. The user is prompted to choose which shape they want drawn. Depending on the shape, there is an option to make it full or hollow. 
The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate understanding of using multiple files for code implementation. This project includes three files; A header, figures.cpp to hold the function definitions, and functionsInput.cpp to hold the main code and get user input.
